# File descriptions
train.csv - the training set
test.csv - the test set
data_description.txt - full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the column names used here
sample_submission.csv - a benchmark submission from a linear regression on year and month of sale, lot square footage, and number of bedrooms

#Data fields
###Here's a brief version of what you'll find in the data description file.

```{r libraries}
#import some necessary librairies
library(tidyverse)    #dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, purrr, stringr, tibble, readr, forcats
library(lubridate)
library(corrplot)
library(ISLR)
library(gbm)
library("car")
library(caret)
library(ggformula)
library(randomForest)
```

```{r import}
#Now let's import and put the train and test datasets in a dataframe
train <- read.csv('train.csv')
test <- read.csv('test.csv')

##display the first five rows of the train dataset.
head(train)

##display the first five rows of the test dataset.
head(test)

#check the numbers of samples and features
"The train data size before dropping Id feature is "
nsize(train)

"The test data size before dropping Id feature is "
nsize(test)

#Save the 'Id' column
train_ID = train['Id']
test_ID = test['Id']

#Now drop the  'Id' colum since it's unnecessary for  the prediction process.
train <- train %>% select(-Id)
test <- test %>% select(-Id)

#check again the data size after dropping the 'Id' variable
"The train data size after dropping Id feature is "
nsize(train)

"The test data size after dropping Id feature is "
nsize(test)
```


#Data Processing

##Outliers

[Documentation][1] for the Ames Housing Data indicates that there are outliers present in the training data [1]: http://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/Decock/DataDocumentation.txt

Let's explore these outliers
```{r outliers}
scatter.smooth(x=train$GrLivArea, y=train$SalePrice, main="Greater Living Area by Sales Price")
boxplot(train$GrLivArea, main="Greater Living Area")  # box plot for 'budget'
```
We can see at the bottom right two with extremely large GrLivArea that are of a low price. These values are huge oultliers. Therefore, we can safely delete them.

```{r outliers}
#Deleting outliers
train <- train %>% subset(GrLivArea>4000 && SalePrice<300000)

#Check the graphic again
scatter.smooth(x=train$GrLivArea, y=train$SalePrice, main="Greater Living Area by Sales Price")
boxplot(train$GrLivArea, main="Greater Living Area")  # box plot for 'GrLivArea'
```
###Note : Outliers removal is note always safe. We decided to delete these two as they are very huge and really bad ( extremely large areas for very low prices).

There are probably others outliers in the training data. However, removing all them may affect badly our models if ever there were also outliers in the test data. That's why , instead of removing them all, we will just manage to make some of our models robust on them. You can refer to the modelling part of this notebook for that.


##Target Variable

SalePrice is the variable we need to predict. So let's do some analysis on this variable first.
```{r target}
boxplot(train$SalePrice, main="Sales Price")  # box plot for 'Sale Price'

# Histogram overlaid with kernel density curve
ggplot(train, aes(x=SalePrice)) + 
    geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),      # Histogram with density instead of count on y-axis
                   binwidth=.5,
                   colour="black", fill="white") +
    geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#FF6666")  + # Overlay with transparent density plot
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(rating, na.rm=T)),   # Ignore NA values for mean
               color="red", linetype="dashed", size=1)

# Get also the QQ-plot
qqPlot(train$SalePrice)
```
The target variable is right skewed. As (linear) models love normally distributed data , we need to transform this variable and make it more normally distributed.


Log-transformation of the target variable
```{python}
# We use the numpy fuction log1p which  applies log(1+x) to all elements of the column
train <- train %>% mutate(SalePrice = log(SalePrice+1))

# Check the new distribution 
boxplot(train$SalePrice, main="Sales Price")  # box plot for 'Sale Price'

# Histogram overlaid with kernel density curve
ggplot(train, aes(x=SalePrice)) + 
    geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),      # Histogram with density instead of count on y-axis
                   binwidth=.5,
                   colour="black", fill="white") +
    geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#FF6666")  + # Overlay with transparent density plot
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(rating, na.rm=T)),   # Ignore NA values for mean
               color="red", linetype="dashed", size=1)

# Get also the QQ-plot
qqPlot(train$SalePrice)
```
The skew seems now corrected and the data appears more normally distributed.


##Features engineering

let's first concatenate the train and test data in the same dataframe
```{r features}
ntrain <- nsize(train)
ntest <- nsize(test)
y_train <- train$SalePrice
all_data <- rbind(train, test) 
all_data <- all_data %>% select(-SalePrice)
"all_data size is "
nsize(all_data)
```

###Missing Data
```{r missing}
all_data_na <- is.na(all_data)


all_data_na = (all_data.isnull().sum() / len(all_data)) * 100
all_data_na = all_data_na.drop(all_data_na[all_data_na == 0].index).sort_values(ascending=False)[:30]
missing_data = pd.DataFrame({'Missing Ratio' :all_data_na})
missing_data.head(20)

f, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 12))
plt.xticks(rotation='90')
sns.barplot(x=all_data_na.index, y=all_data_na)
plt.xlabel('Features', fontsize=15)
plt.ylabel('Percent of missing values', fontsize=15)
plt.title('Percent missing data by feature', fontsize=15)
```

**Data Correlation**
```{r correlation}
#Correlation map to see how features are correlated with SalePrice
train %>% select_if(is.numeric) %>% cor() %>% corrplot(method = "circle")
```


###Imputing missing values

We impute them by proceeding sequentially through features with missing values

**PoolQC** : data description says NA means "No Pool". That make sense, given the huge ratio of missing value (+99%) and majority of houses have no Pool at all in general.
```{python}
all_data["PoolQC"] = all_data["PoolQC"].fillna("None")
```

MiscFeature : data description says NA means "no misc feature"
```{python}
all_data["MiscFeature"] = all_data["MiscFeature"].fillna("None")
```

**Alley** : data description says NA means "no alley access"
```{python}
all_data["Alley"] = all_data["Alley"].fillna("None")
```

**Fence** : data description says NA means "no fence"
```{python}
all_data["Fence"] = all_data["Fence"].fillna("None")
```

**FireplaceQu** : data description says NA means "no fireplace"
```{python}
all_data["FireplaceQu"] = all_data["FireplaceQu"].fillna("None")
```

**LotFrontage** : Since the area of each street connected to the house property most likely have a similar area to other houses in its neighborhood , we can fill in missing values by the median LotFrontage of the neighborhood.

```{python}
#Group by neighborhood and fill in missing value by the median LotFrontage of all the neighborhood
all_data["LotFrontage"] = all_data.groupby("Neighborhood")["LotFrontage"].transform(
    lambda x: x.fillna(x.median()))
```

GarageType, GarageFinish, GarageQual and GarageCond : Replacing missing data with None

```{python}
for col in ('GarageType', 'GarageFinish', 'GarageQual', 'GarageCond'):
    all_data[col] = all_data[col].fillna('None')
```

GarageYrBlt, GarageArea and GarageCars : Replacing missing data with 0 (Since No garage = no cars in such garage.)

```{python}
for col in ('GarageYrBlt', 'GarageArea', 'GarageCars'):
    all_data[col] = all_data[col].fillna(0)
```

BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinSF2, BsmtUnfSF, TotalBsmtSF, BsmtFullBath and BsmtHalfBath : missing values are likely zero for having no basement

```{python}
for col in ('BsmtFinSF1', 'BsmtFinSF2', 'BsmtUnfSF','TotalBsmtSF', 'BsmtFullBath', 'BsmtHalfBath'):
    all_data[col] = all_data[col].fillna(0)
```

BsmtQual, BsmtCond, BsmtExposure, BsmtFinType1 and BsmtFinType2 : For all these categorical basement-related features, NaN means that there is no basement.

```{python}
for col in ('BsmtQual', 'BsmtCond', 'BsmtExposure', 'BsmtFinType1', 'BsmtFinType2'):
    all_data[col] = all_data[col].fillna('None')
```

**MasVnrArea** and **MasVnrType** : NA most likely means no masonry veneer for these houses. We can fill 0 for the area and None for the type.

```{python}
all_data["MasVnrType"] = all_data["MasVnrType"].fillna("None")
all_data["MasVnrArea"] = all_data["MasVnrArea"].fillna(0)
```

**MSZoning** (The general zoning classification) : 'RL' is by far the most common value. So we can fill in missing values with 'RL'

```{python}
all_data['MSZoning'] = all_data['MSZoning'].fillna(all_data['MSZoning'].mode()[0])
```

**Utilities** : For this categorical feature all records are "AllPub", except for one "NoSeWa" and 2 NA . Since the house with 'NoSewa' is in the training set, this feature won't help in predictive modelling. We can then safely remove it.

```{python}
all_data = all_data.drop(['Utilities'], axis=1)
```

**Functional** : data description says NA means typical

```{python}
all_data["Functional"] = all_data["Functional"].fillna("Typ")
```

**Electrical** : It has one NA value. Since this feature has mostly 'SBrkr', we can set that for the missing value.

```{python}
all_data['Electrical'] = all_data['Electrical'].fillna(all_data['Electrical'].mode()[0])
```

KitchenQual: Only one NA value, and same as Electrical, we set 'TA' (which is the most frequent) for the missing value in KitchenQual.

```{python}
all_data['KitchenQual'] = all_data['KitchenQual'].fillna(all_data['KitchenQual'].mode()[0])
```

**Exterior1st** and **Exterior2nd** : Again Both Exterior 1 & 2 have only one missing value. We will just substitute in the most common string

```{python}
all_data['Exterior1st'] = all_data['Exterior1st'].fillna(all_data['Exterior1st'].mode()[0])
all_data['Exterior2nd'] = all_data['Exterior2nd'].fillna(all_data['Exterior2nd'].mode()[0])
```

**SaleType** : Fill in again with most frequent which is "WD"

```{python}
all_data['SaleType'] = all_data['SaleType'].fillna(all_data['SaleType'].mode()[0])
```

**MSSubClass** : Na most likely means No building class. We can replace missing values with None

```{python}
all_data['MSSubClass'] = all_data['MSSubClass'].fillna("None")
```

Is there any remaining missing value ?

```{python}
#Check remaining missing values if any 
all_data_na = (all_data.isnull().sum() / len(all_data)) * 100
all_data_na = all_data_na.drop(all_data_na[all_data_na == 0].index).sort_values(ascending=False)
missing_data = pd.DataFrame({'Missing Ratio' :all_data_na})
missing_data.head()
```

It remains no missing value.


###More features engeneering

Transforming some numerical variables that are really categorical

```{python}
#MSSubClass=The building class
all_data['MSSubClass'] = all_data['MSSubClass'].apply(str)

#Changing OverallCond into a categorical variable
all_data['OverallCond'] = all_data['OverallCond'].astype(str)

#Year and month sold are transformed into categorical features.
all_data['YrSold'] = all_data['YrSold'].astype(str)
all_data['MoSold'] = all_data['MoSold'].astype(str)
```

Label Encoding some categorical variables that may contain information in their ordering set

```{python}
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
cols = ('FireplaceQu', 'BsmtQual', 'BsmtCond', 'GarageQual', 'GarageCond', 
        'ExterQual', 'ExterCond','HeatingQC', 'PoolQC', 'KitchenQual', 'BsmtFinType1', 
        'BsmtFinType2', 'Functional', 'Fence', 'BsmtExposure', 'GarageFinish', 'LandSlope',
        'LotShape', 'PavedDrive', 'Street', 'Alley', 'CentralAir', 'MSSubClass', 'OverallCond', 
        'YrSold', 'MoSold')
# process columns, apply LabelEncoder to categorical features
for c in cols:
    lbl = LabelEncoder() 
    lbl.fit(list(all_data[c].values)) 
    all_data[c] = lbl.transform(list(all_data[c].values))

# shape        
print('Shape all_data: {}'.format(all_data.shape))
```

Adding one more important feature

Since area related features are very important to determine house prices, we add one more feature which is the total area of basement, first and second floor areas of each house

```{python}
# Adding total sqfootage feature 
all_data['TotalSF'] = all_data['TotalBsmtSF'] + all_data['1stFlrSF'] + all_data['2ndFlrSF']
```

**Skewed features**

```{python}
numeric_feats = all_data.dtypes[all_data.dtypes != "object"].index

# Check the skew of all numerical features
skewed_feats = all_data[numeric_feats].apply(lambda x: skew(x.dropna())).sort_values(ascending=False)
print("\nSkew in numerical features: \n")
skewness = pd.DataFrame({'Skew' :skewed_feats})
skewness.head(10)
```

Box Cox Transformation of (highly) skewed features

We use the scipy function boxcox1p which computes the Box-Cox transformation of 1+x1+x.

Note that setting λ=0λ=0 is equivalent to log1p used above for the target variable.

See [this page][1] for more details on Box Cox Transformation as well as [the scipy function's page][2] [1]: http://onlinestatbook.com/2/transformations/box-cox.html [2]: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.19.0/reference/generated/scipy.special.boxcox1p.html

```{python}
skewness = skewness[abs(skewness) > 0.75]
print("There are {} skewed numerical features to Box Cox transform".format(skewness.shape[0]))
```
```{python}
from scipy.special import boxcox1p
skewed_features = skewness.index
lam = 0.15
for feat in skewed_features:
    #all_data[feat] += 1
    all_data[feat] = boxcox1p(all_data[feat], lam)
    
#all_data[skewed_features] = np.log1p(all_data[skewed_features])
```

Getting dummy categorical features

```{python}
all_data = pd.get_dummies(all_data)
print(all_data.shape)
```

Getting the new train and test sets.

```{python}
train = all_data[:ntrain]
test = all_data[ntrain:]
```



#Modelling


Import librairies

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet, Lasso,  BayesianRidge, LassoLarsIC
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor,  GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.kernel_ridge import KernelRidge
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin, RegressorMixin, clone
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold, cross_val_score, train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import xgboost as xgb
import lightgbm as lgb
```

Define a cross validation strategy

We use the cross_val_score function of Sklearn. However this function has not a shuffle attribut, we add then one line of code, in order to shuffle the dataset prior to cross-validation


#Validation function

```{python}
n_folds = 5

def rmsle_cv(model):
    kf = KFold(n_folds, shuffle=True, random_state=42).get_n_splits(train.values)
    rmse= np.sqrt(-cross_val_score(model, train.values, y_train, scoring="neg_mean_squared_error", cv = kf))
    return(rmse)
```

##Base models


**LASSO Regression** :
This model may be very sensitive to outliers. So we need to made it more robust on them. For that we use the sklearn's Robustscaler() method on pipeline

```{python}
lasso = make_pipeline(RobustScaler(), Lasso(alpha =0.0005, random_state=1))
```

**Elastic Net Regression** :
again made robust to outliers


```{python}
ENet = make_pipeline(RobustScaler(), ElasticNet(alpha=0.0005, l1_ratio=.9, random_state=3))
```

**Kernel Ridge Regression** :

```{python}
KRR = KernelRidge(alpha=0.6, kernel='polynomial', degree=2, coef0=2.5)
```

**Gradient Boosting Regression** : With huber loss that makes it robust to outliers

```{python}
GBoost = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=3000, learning_rate=0.05,
                                   max_depth=4, max_features='sqrt',
                                   min_samples_leaf=15, min_samples_split=10, 
                                   loss='huber', random_state =5)
```

**XGBoost** :

```{python}
model_xgb = xgb.XGBRegressor(colsample_bytree=0.4603, gamma=0.0468, 
                             learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=3, 
                             min_child_weight=1.7817, n_estimators=2200,
                             reg_alpha=0.4640, reg_lambda=0.8571,
                             subsample=0.5213, silent=1,
                             random_state =7, nthread = -1)
```

**LightGBM** :

```{python}
model_lgb = lgb.LGBMRegressor(objective='regression',num_leaves=5,
                              learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=720,
                              max_bin = 55, bagging_fraction = 0.8,
                              bagging_freq = 5, feature_fraction = 0.2319,
                              feature_fraction_seed=9, bagging_seed=9,
                              min_data_in_leaf =6, min_sum_hessian_in_leaf = 11)
```

###Base models scores

Let's see how these base models perform on the data by evaluating the cross-validation rmsle error

```{python}
score = rmsle_cv(lasso)
print("\nLasso score: {:.4f} ({:.4f})\n".format(score.mean(), score.std()))

score = rmsle_cv(ENet)
print("ElasticNet score: {:.4f} ({:.4f})\n".format(score.mean(), score.std()))

score = rmsle_cv(KRR)
print("Kernel Ridge score: {:.4f} ({:.4f})\n".format(score.mean(), score.std()))

score = rmsle_cv(GBoost)
print("Gradient Boosting score: {:.4f} ({:.4f})\n".format(score.mean(), score.std()))

score = rmsle_cv(model_xgb)
print("Xgboost score: {:.4f} ({:.4f})\n".format(score.mean(), score.std()))

score = rmsle_cv(model_lgb)
print("LGBM score: {:.4f} ({:.4f})\n" .format(score.mean(), score.std()))
```

##Stacking models


###Simplest Stacking approach : Averaging base models

We begin with this simple approach of averaging base models. We build a new class to extend scikit-learn with our model and also to laverage encapsulation and code reuse (inheritance)

**Averaged base models class**

```{python}
class AveragingModels(BaseEstimator, RegressorMixin, TransformerMixin):
    def __init__(self, models):
        self.models = models
        
    # we define clones of the original models to fit the data in
    def fit(self, X, y):
        self.models_ = [clone(x) for x in self.models]
        
        # Train cloned base models
        for model in self.models_:
            model.fit(X, y)
        return self
    
    #Now we do the predictions for cloned models and average them
    def predict(self, X):
        predictions = np.column_stack([
            model.predict(X) for model in self.models_
        ])
        return np.mean(predictions, axis=1)   
```

**Averaged base models score**

We just average four models here ENet, GBoost, KRR and lasso. Of course we could easily add more models in the mix.

```{python}
averaged_models = AveragingModels(models = (ENet, GBoost, KRR, lasso))

score = rmsle_cv(averaged_models)
print(" Averaged base models score: {:.4f} ({:.4f})\n".format(score.mean(), score.std()))
```

Wow ! It seems even the simplest stacking approach really improve the score . This encourages us to go further and explore a less simple stacking approch.


###Less simple Stacking : Adding a Meta-model

In this approach, we add a meta-model on averaged base models and use the out-of-folds predictions of these base models to train our meta-model.

The procedure, for the training part, may be described as follows:

  Split the total training set into two disjoint sets (here train and .holdout )

  Train several base models on the first part (train)

  Test these base models on the second part (holdout)

  Use the predictions from 3) (called out-of-folds predictions) as the inputs, and the correct responses (target variable) as the outputs to train a higher level learner called meta-model.

The first three steps are done iteratively . If we take for example a 5-fold stacking , we first split the training data into 5 folds. Then we will do 5 iterations. In each iteration, we train every base model on 4 folds and predict on the remaining fold (holdout fold).

So, we will be sure, after 5 iterations , that the entire data is used to get out-of-folds predictions that we will then use as new feature to train our meta-model in the step 4.

For the prediction part , We average the predictions of all base models on the test data and used them as meta-features on which, the final prediction is done with the meta-model.

**kaz**

Gif taken from KazAnova's interview


On this gif, the base models are algorithms 0, 1, 2 and the meta-model is algorithm 3. The entire training dataset is A+B (target variable y known) that we can split into train part (A) and holdout part (B). And the test dataset is C.

B1 (which is the prediction from the holdout part) is the new feature used to train the meta-model 3 and C1 (which is the prediction from the test dataset) is the meta-feature on which the final prediction is done.


### Stacking averaged Models Class

```{python}
class StackingAveragedModels(BaseEstimator, RegressorMixin, TransformerMixin):
    def __init__(self, base_models, meta_model, n_folds=5):
        self.base_models = base_models
        self.meta_model = meta_model
        self.n_folds = n_folds
   
    # We again fit the data on clones of the original models
    def fit(self, X, y):
        self.base_models_ = [list() for x in self.base_models]
        self.meta_model_ = clone(self.meta_model)
        kfold = KFold(n_splits=self.n_folds, shuffle=True, random_state=156)
        
        # Train cloned base models then create out-of-fold predictions
        # that are needed to train the cloned meta-model
        out_of_fold_predictions = np.zeros((X.shape[0], len(self.base_models)))
        for i, model in enumerate(self.base_models):
            for train_index, holdout_index in kfold.split(X, y):
                instance = clone(model)
                self.base_models_[i].append(instance)
                instance.fit(X[train_index], y[train_index])
                y_pred = instance.predict(X[holdout_index])
                out_of_fold_predictions[holdout_index, i] = y_pred
                
        # Now train the cloned  meta-model using the out-of-fold predictions as new feature
        self.meta_model_.fit(out_of_fold_predictions, y)
        return self
   
    #Do the predictions of all base models on the test data and use the averaged predictions as 
    #meta-features for the final prediction which is done by the meta-model
    def predict(self, X):
        meta_features = np.column_stack([
            np.column_stack([model.predict(X) for model in base_models]).mean(axis=1)
            for base_models in self.base_models_ ])
        return self.meta_model_.predict(meta_features)
```

**Stacking Averaged models Score**

To make the two approaches comparable (by using the same number of models) , we just average Enet KRR and Gboost, then we add lasso as meta-model.


```{python}
stacked_averaged_models = StackingAveragedModels(base_models = (ENet, GBoost, KRR),
                                                 meta_model = lasso)
score = rmsle_cv(stacked_averaged_models)
print("Stacking Averaged models score: {:.4f} ({:.4f})".format(score.mean(), score.std()))
```

We get again a better score by adding a meta learner


## Ensembling StackedRegressor, XGBoost and LightGBM


We add XGBoost and LightGBM to the StackedRegressor defined previously.

We first define a rmsle evaluation function

```{python}
def rmsle(y, y_pred):
    return np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y, y_pred))
```

###Final Training and Prediction


**StackedRegressor** :
  
```{python}
stacked_averaged_models.fit(train.values, y_train)
stacked_train_pred = stacked_averaged_models.predict(train.values)
stacked_pred = np.expm1(stacked_averaged_models.predict(test.values))
print(rmsle(y_train, stacked_train_pred))
```

**XGBoost** :
  
```{python}
model_xgb.fit(train, y_train)
xgb_train_pred = model_xgb.predict(train)
xgb_pred = np.expm1(model_xgb.predict(test))
print(rmsle(y_train, xgb_train_pred))
```

**LightGBM** :

```{python}
model_lgb.fit(train, y_train)
lgb_train_pred = model_lgb.predict(train)
lgb_pred = np.expm1(model_lgb.predict(test.values))
print(rmsle(y_train, lgb_train_pred))
```

```{python}
'''RMSE on the entire Train data when averaging'''
print('RMSLE score on train data:')
print(rmsle(y_train,stacked_train_pred*0.70 +
               xgb_train_pred*0.15 + lgb_train_pred*0.15 ))
```

**Ensemble prediction** :

```{python}
ensemble = stacked_pred*0.70 + xgb_pred*0.15 + lgb_pred*0.15
```

### Submission

```{python}
sub = pd.DataFrame()
sub['Id'] = test_ID
sub['SalePrice'] = ensemble
sub.to_csv('submission.csv',index=False)
```
